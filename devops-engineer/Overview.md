# Overview

This interview contains a series of scenarios to work through. These scenarios include interacting with Kubernetes clusters and other terminal DevOps technologies.

To start, lets check that we have a shared terminal.

Now click on the Explorer icon on the top left if it is not already selected and under `devops-engineer`, expand `Questions` to reveal the questions. 

Back to the terminal window, it will be easier to work from this devops directory, run: `cd /config/workspace/devops-engineer/Questions/Kubernetes/`

Click on `Question1.md` and lets get started!
